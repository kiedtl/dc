# dungeon craft

Dungeon Craft (or, as it will also be referred to, DC) is a 2D,
console-based game that aims to combine the gameplay of traditional
rogue-like games (especially Dungeon Crawler Stone Soup) and voxel-based
game such as Minecraft and Minetest.

Like rogue-like games, the game occurs in an underground cavern system;
unlike rogue games, there is only one level. As in Minetest, hostile
mobs are randomly generated throughout the map; however, these mobs are
almost always more dangerous than their Minetest counterparts.

The substances the map is composed of may be mined, and then arranged into
new structures, as in Minetest.
